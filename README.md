ðŸ›‘ Hate Speech Detection:  <br>
This repository contains an implementation of a Hate Speech Detection system using Neural Network techniques. The goal of the project is to build a model that can classify text data into hate speech and non-hate speech, helping to automate the detection of harmful language online.

ðŸš€ Project Overview: <br>
Objective: To detect hate speech in textual data using machine learning algorithms.
Approach: The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and building classification models to predict whether a given text contains hate speech.
Techniques Used: Various machine learning algorithms are implemented, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression. <br>

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  <br>
There are 2 sub folders named LSTM & BERT in which the python script is there, containing the implementation of the hate speech detection models.
README.md: Project documentation and instructions.

ðŸ“Š Dataset:  <br>
The dataset used for this project contains labeled text samples, categorized as either hate speech or non-hate speech. Each text sample is preprocessed and used to train machine learning models.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:  <br>
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization using TF-IDF.
Modeling: Multiple machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression, are trained and evaluated for hate speech detection.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
